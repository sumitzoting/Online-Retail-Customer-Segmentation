# Online-Retail-Customer-Segmentation
The following conclusions are made as per my discussion with my team, and this is my contribution.
              Firstly, we did clustering based on RFM analysis. We had 4 clusters/Segmentation of customers based on RFM score. Platinum customers=1263 (less recency but high frequency and heavy spending). Gold customers=1324 (good recency, frequency and monetary). Silver customers=981(high recency, low frequency and low spending). Bronze customers=770 (very high recency but very less frequency and spending).
              In Machine Learning (ML) algorithms, I performed on experiment K-Means Clustering with Elbow method (Frequency and Monetary), K-Means with Silhouette Score method (Frequency and Monetary) and DBSCAN (Frequency and Monetary)
